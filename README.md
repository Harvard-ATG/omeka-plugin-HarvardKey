# Omeka Harvard Key Plugin

**HarvardKey** is a plugin that adds a login option so that users can authenticate with the Harvard Key system in addition to logging in with a username and password.

## Setup

1. Install into the Omeka plugins directory. 
2. Update `auth.ini` settings so that the `url` points to the appropriate login endpoint at the CAS/SAML service provider, and the `secret_key` is the same as the one used by the service provider to sign the identity token returned in the cookie.

## Description

This plugin does not use the CAS/SAML protocol directly, but instead interfaces with an intermediate auth service provider which handles that part of the authentication process. The auth service provider simply returns a cryptographically signed cookie (JSON format) with identity information including name, email, and ID (the eduPersonPrincipalName) to the plugin. 

Omeka can use the identity information to create a new account or link to an existing account based on the email address.

## Assumptions

- An authentication provider exists on the same domain as the omeka site (so cookies can be shared). This provider handles the CAS/SAML auth flow with the Harvard Key identity provider.
- The authentication provider will return a signed token (via cookie) with identity information such as _eduPersonPrincipalName_, _mail_, and _displayName_.
- The plugin will be configured with authorization rules that determine whether users are permitted to login or not, and what role/permissions they are assigned.
